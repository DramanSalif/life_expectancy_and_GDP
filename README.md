# Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis

## Understand the problem

- As defined [here](https://www.researchgate.net/topic/Life-Expectancy), *Life Expectancy* is a figure representing the number of years, based on known statistics, to which any person of a given age may reasonably expect to live. 

- As defined [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/life-expectancy-vs-gross-domestic-product-using-data-analyticsbc0d5c78043f#:~:text=The%20relationship%20is%20evident%20but,between%20GDP%20and%20Life%20expectancy), *Gross Domestic Product (GDP)* is the overall monetary or consumer value of all finished goods and services produced within the boundaries of a nation over a given period. It acts as a large measure of overall domestic output, as a detailed scorecard of the economic health of the country. GDP is measured in US dollars.

## Goal

In this project, we will analyze data on Life Expectancy at Birth (years) (LEABY) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from the [World Health Organization](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688) and the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) to try to identify the relationship between the GDP and LEABY of six countries (Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, United States of America, Zimbabwe) over fifteen years.

During this project, we will analyze, prepare, and plot data in order to answer in a meaningful way some questions such as:

- Does higher GDP mean higher LEABY?
- How does the LEABY vary in average by country from 2000 to 2015?
- How does the GDP vary in average  by country from 2000 to 2015?
- Is a correlation between GDP and LEABY for the countries from 2000 to 2015?

**Data sources**

- Life expectancy Data Source: [World Health Organization](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688)
- GDP Source: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) national accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files.


## Action

- Import Python librairies
- Load in the dataset
- Check for data information
- Explore the LEABY per country from 2000 to 2015
- Explore tthe GDP per country from 2000 to 2015
- Visualize the correlation between LEAB and GDP from 2000 to 2015


## Conclusion

- Analyse our findings
- Conclude
